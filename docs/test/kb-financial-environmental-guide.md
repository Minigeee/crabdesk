## Energy Savings Calculations

### Residential Calculations

1. **Monthly Savings**

   ```
   Monthly Savings =
   (Monthly kWh Production × Utility Rate)
   + Net Metering Credits
   - Monthly Payment
   ```

2. **Annual Savings**

   ```
   Annual Savings =
   Σ(Monthly Savings)
   + Tax Incentives
   + Utility Incentives
   ```

3. **Lifetime Savings**
   ```
   Lifetime Savings =
   (Annual Savings × System Life)
   + Property Value Increase
   - Maintenance Costs
   ```

### Commercial Calculations

1. **Energy Cost Savings**

   ```
   Energy Savings =
   (Annual kWh Production × Blended Rate)
   + Demand Charge Reduction
   ```

2. **Tax Benefit Calculations**

   ```
   Tax Benefits =
   Federal ITC
   + Depreciation Benefits
   + State/Local Incentives
   ```

3. **Net Present Value**
   ```
   NPV =
   Initial Investment
   + Σ(Annual Cash Flows / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year)
   ```

### Performance Metrics

1. **System Efficiency**

   ```
   System Efficiency =
   Actual Production / Expected Production
   ```

2. **Financial Performance**

   ```
   ROI =
   (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
   ```

3. **Environmental Impact**
   ```
   CO2 Reduction =
   Annual kWh × Grid Carbon Factor
   ```

   - Production tracking
   - Consumption analysis
   - Performance alerts
   - Weather normalization

2. **Financial Tracking**

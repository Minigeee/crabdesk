# About SolarTech Solutions

## Our Story

Founded in 2015, SolarTech Solutions emerged from a simple yet powerful vision: to make sustainable energy accessible, affordable, and intelligent for everyone. What began as a small team of solar enthusiasts in Austin, Texas, has grown into a leading clean energy technology company serving residential and commercial customers across five states.

Our journey started when our founders, Sarah Chen and Michael Rodriguez, recognized that the solar industry needed more than just hardware solutionsâ€”it needed intelligent, integrated systems that could maximize energy efficiency while simplifying the user experience. This insight led to the development of our signature smart energy management systems, which combine cutting-edge solar technology with AI-powered optimization.

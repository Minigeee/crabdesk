## Notes
- Tasks are ordered by dependency and foundation-first approach
- Each task focuses on core functionality needed for MVP
- Advanced features like AI assistance, complex automations, and advanced analytics will be implemented in later phases
- Routes follow the structure defined in routes.md
- Database operations use Supabase client directly instead of REST API endpoints

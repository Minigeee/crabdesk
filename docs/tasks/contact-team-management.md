# Contact and Team Management Tasks

## Contact Management Core

**Context**: Implement a simple but effective contact management system that allows viewing and managing customer contacts that are automatically created through email interactions. The focus is on providing essential contact information and history without unnecessary complexity.

**Considerations**:
- Contacts are primarily created through email interactions
- Contact data should be server-side rendered with React Query for updates
- Keep the UI simple and focused on most important information
- Notes system should be straightforward with plain text entries
- Search and filtering should use URL parameters for shareability

### Data Layer Setup

1. [X] Create contact service module
   - Implement type-safe database queries
   - Set up proper error handling
   - Add caching strategy
   - Create contact DTOs

2. [X] Set up contact notes table
   - Add foreign key to contacts
   - Track author and timestamp
   - Implement proper indices
   - Add RLS policies

3. [X] Implement search functionality
   - Search by name/email
   - Add type-safe query builders

### Contact List View

1. [ ] Create contacts page layout
   - Server-side pagination component
   - Responsive grid/list view
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Empty state design

2. [ ] Implement search and filters
   - Search by name/email
   - Filter by last interaction
   - URL-based filter state
   - Clear filters button

3. [ ] Add contact list functionality
   - Display basic contact info
   - Show last interaction date
   - Add quick actions menu
   - Implement proper loading states

## Contact Details View

**Context**: Detailed view of a single contact showing their complete profile, interaction history, and notes. This view should provide all essential information about the contact while maintaining simplicity.

**Considerations**:
- Most data can be server-side rendered
- Notes need periodic polling or lightweight real-time updates
- Reuse existing ticket creation form
- Keep the UI clean and focused

### Core Implementation

1. [ ] Create contact details page
   - Three-column responsive layout
   - Loading skeleton
   - Error states
   - Mobile optimization

2. [ ] Implement profile section
   - Display contact information
   - Show key metrics
   - Add edit capability
   - Handle validation

3. [ ] Build interaction history
   - List recent tickets
   - Show email threads
   - Implement proper pagination
   - Add loading states

4. [ ] Create notes system
   - Notes list component
   - Add note form
   - Delete note capability
   - Author tracking

## Team Management

**Context**: Simple team management system for organizing users and handling ticket routing. Focus on essential team operations without complex hierarchies.

**Considerations**:
- Teams are flat structure (no hierarchies)
- Team data is mostly static, can be server-side rendered
- Member management needs real-time updates
- Changes should be tracked in audit logs

### Core Team Features

1. [ ] Set up teams page
   - List view of teams
   - Basic team metrics
   - Loading states
   - Error handling

2. [ ] Implement team creation
   - Create team form
   - Validation handling
   - Success/error states
   - Proper type safety

3. [ ] Add member management
   - Member list component
   - Add/remove members
   - Role assignment
   - Proper error handling

4. [ ] Create team metrics
   - Basic performance stats
   - Ticket resolution times
   - Member activity
   - Loading states

## Data Dependencies

### Contact Management
- Contacts table
- Contact notes table
- Tickets table (for history)
- Email threads table
- Users table (for note authorship)

### Team Management
- Teams table
- Team members table
- Users table
- Tickets table (for metrics)
- Audit logs table

## Route Structure

```
/app
└── dashboard
    ├── contacts
    │   ├── page.tsx
    │   └── [id]
    │       └── page.tsx
    └── teams
        ├── page.tsx
        └── [id]
            └── page.tsx
```

## Implementation Order

1. Start with Contact Management Core
   - This provides essential customer data visibility
   - Focus on search and basic information display
   - Implement notes system early for user feedback

2. Then Contact Details View
   - Build on core contact management
   - Add interaction history
   - Implement note taking

3. Finally Team Management
   - Start with basic team CRUD
   - Add member management
   - Implement metrics last

## Technical Notes

- Use server components where possible
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Keep forms simple and focused
- Use URL state for filters
- Maintain proper TypeScript types

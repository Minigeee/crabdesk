# AI Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the automated AI workflow for handling customer communications in CrabDesk. The system employs multiple specialized AI agents working in concert to process, analyze, and respond to customer emails, with human operators providing final oversight and approval.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Ticket Creation

- When an organization receives an email, the system automatically creates a ticket
- The email thread is associated with the ticket and stored for context
- Initial metadata is captured (sender, timestamp, subject, etc.)

### 2. Priority Categorization

**Agent**: Priority Level Categorizer

**Purpose**: Automatically assess and assign ticket priority levels

**Process**:

- Analyzes incoming email content and metadata
- Evaluates urgency based on:
  - Content sentiment and tone
  - Keywords and phrases indicating urgency
  - Customer history and status
  - Time-sensitive elements
- Assigns priority level:
  - Urgent: Immediate attention required
  - High: Important but not critical
  - Normal: Standard priority
  - Low: Non-time-sensitive matters

### 3. Thread Summarization

**Agent**: Summarizer

**Purpose**: Maintain an up-to-date summary of the email thread

**Process**:

- Creates initial summary upon ticket creation
- Updates summary with each new email in the thread
- Focuses on:
  - Core issue or request
  - Key points of discussion
  - Current status
  - Action items
- Attaches summary as a note to the ticket

### 4. Auto Response Generation

**Agent**: Auto Responder

**Purpose**: Draft contextually appropriate responses using available knowledge

**Process**:

- Analyzes email thread and ticket context
- Performs RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using:
  - Organization's knowledge base articles
  - Previous ticket notes and resolutions
  - Customer interaction history
- Generates draft response considering:
  - Specific customer inquiry
  - Organization tone and style guidelines
  - Previous successful responses
  - Retrieved context from knowledge base

### 5. Response Quality Assessment

**Agent**: Response Grader

**Purpose**: Evaluate auto-generated responses for quality and appropriateness

**Process**:

- Reviews draft responses against defined criteria
- Provides quality score and feedback
- Flags potential issues or concerns
- Evaluates:
  - Response accuracy
  - Tone appropriateness
  - Goal alignment
  - Completeness
  - Professional standards

### 6. Human Oversight

**Role**: Human Operators

**Purpose**: Final review and approval of AI-generated responses

**Process**:

- Review auto-generated responses
- Make necessary edits or adjustments
- Approve responses for sending
- Provide feedback to improve AI performance

## Quality Control Testing Framework

### 1. RAG Accuracy Testing

### 3. Tone Adaptation Testing

**Objective**: Verify appropriate tone selection and consistency

**Test Criteria**:

- Customer sentiment recognition
- Tone appropriateness
- Consistency throughout response
- Brand voice alignment

**Testing Methods**:

- Sentiment analysis accuracy tests
- Tone consistency evaluation
- Brand voice compliance checks
- Customer satisfaction correlation

### 4. Grader Agent Validation

**Objective**: Ensure accurate quality assessment of responses

**Test Criteria**:

1. Goal Alignment

- Organization objectives match
- Solution appropriateness
- Strategic alignment
- Value proposition clarity

2. Information Accuracy

- Factual correctness
- Source verification

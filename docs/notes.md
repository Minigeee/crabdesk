# AI Coding Workflow

## Foundations and Set Up

- Determine which common systems are needed
  - Utility files
  - Commonly used components
  - Error handling system
- Determine the app structure
  - The app structure should be informed by project requirements, target users, and core systems
  - Keep the user experience in mind when designing the app structure

## Creating Actionable Tasks

- When creating actionable feature tasks, the task should be detailed enough for the coder agent to:
  - Understand feature requirements
  - Understand why the feature is needed
  - How it fits into the overall product
  - Which user types will have access to or use the feature
  - The user experience the feature should provide
